	abstract = {Abstract Ensemble weather predictions require statistical postprocessing of systematic errors to obtain reliable and accurate probabilistic forecasts. Traditionally, this is accomplished with distributional regression models in which the parameters of a predictive distribution are estimated from a training period. We propose a flexible alternative based on neural networks that can incorporate nonlinear relationships between arbitrary predictor variables and forecast distribution parameters that are automatically learned in a data-driven way rather than requiring prespecified link functions. In a case study of 2-m temperature forecasts at surface stations in Germany, the neural network approach significantly outperforms benchmark postprocessing methods while being computationally more affordable. Key components to this improvement are the use of auxiliary predictor variables and station-specific information with the help of embeddings. Furthermore, the trained neural network can be used to gain insight into the importance of meteorological variables, thereby challenging the notion of neural networks as uninterpretable black boxes. Our approach can easily be extended to other statistical postprocessing and forecasting problems. We anticipate that recent advances in deep learning combined with the ever-increasing amounts of model and observation data will transform the postprocessing of numerical weather forecasts in the coming decade.},

	abstract = {Characterizing localized climate conditions is becoming important in many aspects of modern society. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) models have been used to predict localized environmental variations. Further, the recently developed Urban Canopy Model (UCM), derived from energy balance equations, represents more detailed urban characteristics, when it is coupled with the WRF model. However, such physics-based numerical models can exhibit a spatially and temporally heterogeneous discrepancy pattern compared to actual climate conditions possibly due to inappropriate model specifications and/or incorrect choices of model parameters. This study devises a new method that post-calibrates geographically- and temporally-varying discrepancy in an integrative framework. Tested on urban temperature data collected in the central Texas region during heat wave events, our case study demonstrates that the proposed method substantially reduces prediction errors over the original WRF/UCM projection and other alternative approaches. Based on the results, we quantify the building energy consumption at spatially dispersed locations. Note to Practitioners—As electricity is a key component of modern society, the economy, and human well-being, the ability to assess the consumption of electricity is increasingly important. This assessment is challenging due to heterogeneous meteorological patterns. While the numerical weather prediction model, such as WRF/UCM, provides localized weather conditions, its output may not be accurate when its parameters and boundary conditions are not properly specified. In particular, we observe the prediction error from WRF/UCM is spatially- and temporally-varying due to the urban heat island effect during heat wave events. This study develops an integrative framework which provides a methodology to post-correct such heterogeneous prediction error. Our case study using data collected in the central Texas region suggests that the energy consumption at highly urbanized areas can be 0.4 kWh-0.5 kWh larger than its surrounding areas during the heat wave periods. The results demonstrate how the proposed approach can benefit a real application use case.},

	abstract = {A functional time series approach is proposed for investigating spatial correlation in daily maximum temperature forecast errors for 111 cities spread across the U.S. The modelling of spatial correlation is most fruitful for longer forecast horizons, and becomes less relevant as the forecast horizon shrinks towards zero. For 6-day-ahead forecasts, the functional approach uncovers interpretable regional spatial effects, and captures the higher variance observed in inland cities versus coastal cities, as well as the higher variance observed in mountain and midwest states. The functional approach also naturally handles missing data through modelling a continuum, and can be implemented efficiently by exploiting the sparsity induced by a B-spline basis. The temporal dependence in the data is modeled through temporal dependence in functional basis coefficients. Independent first order autoregressions with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity [AR(1)+GARCH(1,1)] and Student-t innovations work well to capture the persistence of basis coefficients over time and the seasonal heteroskedasticity reflecting higher variance in winter. Through exploiting autocorrelation in the basis coefficients, the functional time series approach also yields a method for improving weather forecasts and uncertainty quantification. The resulting method corrects for bias in the weather forecasts, while reducing the error variance.},

Selecting an appropriate wind farm site can benefit from understanding nonstationary characteristics of wind speeds. In particular, wind speed exhibits a diurnal pattern and the pattern varies, day-by-day and site-by-site. The goal of this article is to develop a new probabilistic modeling approach for quantifying variation in the wind diurnal pattern for assessing wind resource at unmonitored locations. Specifically, we formulate the coefficient of wind model as a latent random process and incorporate both day-to-day and spatial variability into the latent process. The estimation performance of the proposed approach is validated with actual data collected in west Texas. The results demonstrate that our approach can capture both spatially- and daily-varying patterns and quantify the uncertainty successfully.},

	abstract = {We analyse historical (1900 – present) and recent (year 2002) data on New York city’s urban heat island (UHI) effect, to characterize changes over time and spatially within the city. The historical annual data show that UHI intensification is responsible for ∼1/3 of the total warming the city has experienced since 1900. The intensification correlates with a significant drop in windspeed over the century, likely due to an increase in the urban boundary layer as Manhattan’s extensive skyline development unfolded. For the current-day, using 2002 data, we calculate the hourly and seasonal strength of the city’s UHI for five different case study areas, including sites in Manhattan, Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn. We find substantial intra-city variation (∼2 °C) in the strength of the hourly UHI, with some locations showing daytime cool islands – i.e., temperatures lower than the average of the distant non-urban stations, while others, at the same time, show daytime heat islands. The variations are not easily explained in terms of land surface characteristics such as building stock, population, vegetation fraction or radiometric surface temperatures from remote sensing. Although it has been suggested that stations within urban parks will underestimate UHI, the Central Park station does not show a significant underestimate, except marginally during summer nights. The intra-city heat island variations in the residential areas broadly correlate with summertime electricity demand and sensitivity to temperature increases. This relationship will have practical value for energy demand management policy, as it will help prioritize areas for UHI mitigation.},

The U.S. Navy's Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) produces real-time forecasts across the region on a 1-km resolution grid and employs an urban canopy parameterization to account for the influence of the city on the atmosphere. Forecasts from the National Weather Service's 12-km resolution North American Mesoscale (NAM) implementation of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are also examined. The accuracy of the forecasts is evaluated using a land- and coastline-based observation network. Observed temperatures reached 39°C or more at central urban sites over several days and remained high overnight due to urban heat island (UHI) effects, with a typical nighttime urban–rural temperature difference of 4°–5°C. Examining model performance broadly over both heat events and 27 sites, COAMPS has temperature RMS errors averaging 1.9°C, while NAM has RMSEs of 2.5°C. COAMPS high-resolution wind and temperature predictions captured key features of the observations. For example, during the early summer June heat event, the Long Island south shore coastline experienced a more pronounced sea breeze than was observed for the July heat wave.},

This paper reviews the most relevant methods that were applied during the Global Energy Forecasting Competition of 2014 (GEFCom2014) and presents a new approach to weather station selection, based on Genetic Algorithms (GA), which allows finding the best set of stations for any demand forecasting model, and outperforms the results of existing methods. Furthermore its performance has also been tested using GEFCom2012 data, providing significant error improvements.

The raw data collected by local weather stations and archived by government agencies often include many missing values and incorrect readings, and thus cannot be used directly by load forecasters. As a result, many power companies today purchase data from commercial weather service vendors. Such quality-controlled data may still have many defects, but many load forecasters have been using them in full faith. This paper proposes a novel temperature anomaly detection methodology that makes use of the local load information collected by power companies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through two public datasets: one from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 and the other from ISO New England. The results show that the accuracy of the final load forecasts can be enhanced by removing the detected observations from the original input data.},

	abstract = {Weather is often found to be a key driving factor for power generation and energy consumption. To capture the effects of weather, many energy forecasting practices, such as load forecasting, renewable power generation forecasting, gas and electricity price forecasting, and power distribution systems outage forecasting, would rely on numerical weather prediction (NWP). In the academic literature, however, energy forecasting models have often been developed based on settings of ex post forecasting, where the actual observations of weather variables during the forecasted period are being used. Such gap between academic research and field practices is partly due to the shortage of historical weather forecasts. To that end, an NWP forecast dataset from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) High Resolution (HRES) model, as available in the ECMWF’s Archive Catalogue, is offered to the energy forecasting community under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

Four years (2017–2020) of HRES forecasts of 14 frequently used weather variables, over the geographical region bounded by 63° N, −126°W, 21° S, and 36° E (most of Europe and North America), on a 0.5°by 0.5°longitude/latitude grid, are released in the form of NetCDF files.

This paper answers the question: given a number of weather stations, how should they be combined for load forecasting? Simple averaging has been a commonly used and effective method in the literature. In this paper, we compared the performance of seven alternative methods with simple averaging as the benchmark using the data of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012.

However, modelling load using weather is challenging because the relationship cannot be assumed to be linear. Although numerous studies have focussed on load forecasting, the literature on using the uncertainty in weather while estimating the load probability distribution is scarce. In this study, we model load for Great Britain using weather ensemble predictions, for lead times from one to six days ahead. A weather ensemble comprises a range of plausible future scenarios for a weather variable. It has been shown that the ensembles from weather models tend to be biased and underdispersed, which requires that the ensembles are post-processed. Surprisingly, the post-processing of weather ensembles has not yet been employed for probabilistic load forecasting. We post-process ensembles based on: (1) ensemble model output statistics: to correct for bias and dispersion errors by calibrating the ensembles, and (2) ensemble copula coupling: to ensure that ensembles remain physically consistent scenarios after calibration. The proposed approach compares favourably to the case when no weather information, raw weather ensembles or post-processed ensembles without ensemble copula coupling are used during the load modelling.},

However, potentially useful predictability information contained in large-scale spatial structures within the input fields is potentially lost in this interpolation step. Therefore, we propose the use of convolutional autoencoders to learn compact representations of spatial input fields which can then be used to augment location-specific information as additional inputs to post-processing models.

	abstract = {Short-term load forecasting (STLF) is critical for the energy industry. Accurate predictions of future electricity demand are necessary to ensure power systems’ reliable and efficient operation. Various STLF models have been proposed in recent years, each with strengths and weaknesses. This paper comprehensively reviews some STLF models, including time series, artificial neural networks (ANNs), regression-based, and hybrid models. It first introduces the fundamental concepts and challenges of STLF, then discusses each model class’s main features and assumptions. The paper compares the models in terms of their accuracy, robustness, computational efficiency, scalability, and adaptability and identifies each approach’s advantages and limitations. Although this study suggests that ANNs and hybrid models may be the most promising ways to achieve accurate and reliable STLF, additional research is required to handle multiple input features, manage massive data sets, and adjust to shifting energy conditions.},

	abstract = {Heating load prediction plays an important role in supporting the operation of a residential district energy station. To find out the most suitable prediction algorithm, seven popular machine learning algorithms are applied in a district heating load dataset from Shanghai, China. The data derived from electric power sensor, thermal sensor and meteorological sensor, weather forecast are combined into four input selections to evaluate model performance. Research on the length setting of prediction time horizon for prediction target and the length of historical time series data for input selection are also conducted to investigate corresponding performance changes. The results show that Support Vector Regression (SVR) performs best in Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) with 5.21\%. XGBoost performs best in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) with 59.75 kW. However, SVR, XGBoost and Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM) have similar performance. Further investigation shows that the consistent increase in the length of historical data sets does not help to improve the performance. The length of historical data sets is recommended to be 28 h. Meanwhile, the span of prediction horizon has slight influence on the performance. It is also found that model performance is primarily influenced by the weather forecasting data.},

	abstract = {Short-term load forecast (STLF) plays an important role in power system operations. This paper proposes a spline bases-assisted Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for STLF with a semi-parametric model being adopted to determine the suitable spline bases for constructing the RNN model. To reduce the exposure to real-time uncertainties, interpolation is achieved by an adapted mean adjustment and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) scheme for finer time interval forecast adjustment. To circumvent the effects of forecasted apparent temperature bias, the forecasted temperatures issued by the weather bureau are adjusted using the average of the forecast errors over the preceding 28 days. The proposed RNN model is trained using 15-min interval load data from the Taiwan Power Company (TPC) and has been used by system operators since 2019. Forecast results show that the spline bases-assisted RNN-STLF method accurately predicts the short-term variations in power demand over the studied time period. The proposed real-time short-term load calibration scheme can help accommodate unexpected changes in load patterns and shows great potential for real-time applications.},

	abstract = {The role of electricity in our daily lives has been steadily growing, and the socioeconomic data shows an indisputable link between the flourishing of modern societies and the expansion of its electric power systems infrastructure. The 21st century brought an increased awareness of global warming as a serious threat, which is deeply rooted in the prolonged greenhouse emissions. This prompted policy makers and societies to adopt several transformations that, in turn, result in a continuously challenging environment. In face of this scenario, short-term load forecasting (STLF) continues to be a crucial task for a better decision-making, not only for the System Operator, but also for market participants, distributors, and retailers. In addition, the proposal of more disaggregated load forecasting has been a new spark to this field, much due to the progress of smart-grids projects, where the implementation of self-consumption, load-scheduling and demand-response requires an estimated knowledge of the load consumption. The STLF literature offers a comprehensive variety of different methods to perform the prediction task. Currently, machine-learning (ML) based methods are the predominant choice to build forecasters, primarily due to their capability to deal with complex load patterns. This study aims to characterize this rich framework, by briefly delving into the working principle, architecture, and other performance issues, that help contextualize the cherry-picked influential contributions. These comprise the main ML-based STLF methods. A discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each method is provided in the end, resulting in a useful overview and guidance for future research work.},

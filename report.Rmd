# Project overview

This project has two main objectives. First, to investigate sea breeze effects
on daily peak utility loads, and to determine whether NYC Micronet weather
stations can be used to create a more accurate TV variable. Second, to create TV
and load forecasts, possibly incorporating NYC Micronet observations or other
weather data available to UAlbany researchers.

```{r sea-breeze-freq}
sea_breeze_freq = readRDS('results/weather/sea_breeze_freq.rds')
sea_breeze_pct = (100 * prop.table(sea_breeze_freq)[2]) %>%
  round %>%
  as.character
```

```{r system-results-text}
system_results = readRDS('results/select_stations/system_results.rds')
sys_pct_improvement = system_results %>%
  with(100 * (1 - (errors[2, 2] / errors[1, 2]))) %>%
  round %>%
  as.character
```

For the first objective, we find that sea breezes occur on about
`r#sea_breeze_pct`% of summer days, and sea breeze patterns appear in individual
network loads. Compared to the combined TV from NYC and LGA stations, TV
incorporating other weather stations can predict loads with
`r#sys_pct_improvement`% less error at the system level. At the individual
network level, incorporating more stations leads to lower prediction errors for
networks outside of Manhattan.

For the second objective, which is still in progress, we plan to use historical
forecast archives to apply a statistical (possibly machine learning-based)
forecast calibration. Even modern weather forecast models contain biases that
can be corrected, so this gives us an advantage over approaches that don't
include the calibration.

# Weather and load background

## Historical patterns

NYC temperatures tend to peak at around 3 or 4pm, while loads peak slightly
afterward at 4 or 5pm.

```{r peak-hours, fig.height=3}
tmp_hist = readRDS('results/weather/max_tmp_times.rds')
load_hist = readRDS('results/energy_loads/max_load_times.rds')
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(tmp_hist, main = 'Hour of maximum temperature', xlab = 'Hour (EDT)',
     xlim = c(9, 23), xaxt = 'n')
axis(1, at = seq(9, 24, 3))
plot(load_hist, main = 'Hour of peak load', xlab = 'Hour (EDT)',
     xlim = c(9, 23), xaxt = 'n')
axis(1, at = seq(9, 24, 3))
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

Network sizes and loads vary widely. The plots below show that Brooklyn has the
largest networks both in terms of size and load, while Manhattan has many
smaller networks that collectively use an enormous amount of power. Peak load
densities (load per area) vary so widely that we had to adopt a log scale to
display them.

```{r network-peaks, fig.height=8, message=FALSE}
network_peaks = readRDS('results/energy_loads/network_peaks.rds')
p1 = plot_station_data(network_peaks, aes(fill = peak), nyc_base, alpha = .9) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c('Peak load (MW)', option = 'magma') +
  theme(legend.justification = c(0, .5), plot.caption = element_text(size = 7))
p2 = plot_station_data(network_peaks, aes(fill = peak_density), nyc_base, alpha = .9) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c('Peak density (MW/miÂ²)', trans = 'log10', option = 'magma') +
  theme(legend.justification = c(0, .5), plot.caption = element_text(size = 7))
grid::grid.draw(rbind(ggplotGrob(p1), ggplotGrob(p2), size = 'last'))
```

## Cogeneration-related outliers

In the individual network load data, we discovered sequences of outliers that
sometimes persist for weeks. One of the longest-running examples is shown below.
The plots show comparisons of daily peak loads for network 32M and surrounding
stations from May through September 2022 (units are MW). The plots show that,
for every combination of networks except 32M, the relationship between loads is
stable for all months, with a nearly-linear relationship. Only for network 32M
does this relationship break down, during a sequence of days in May (colored
red).

```{r cogen-outliers}
cogen_data = readRDS('results/load_vs_weather/tv_and_load_uncleaned.rds')
# rename 'reading' to 'peak' for clarity
names(cogen_data) = sub('reading', 'peak', names(cogen_data))
o4 = readRDS('results/load_vs_weather/load_outliers.rds')
cogen_data %>%
  subset(year == 2022,
         select = paste0('peak.', c('32M', '10M', '7M', '22M', '6M'))) %>%
  pairs(col = factor(o4$outliers[cogen_data$year == 2022, '32M']),
        main = '32M peak load comparisons (2022, May is red)')
```

Brian Cerruti was able to tell us that these outliers were caused by maintenance
at the cogeneration plant at NYU, which is in network 32M. This maintenance
tends to happen in early May and late September, and explains many of the
outlier sequences we noticed in other networks.

At the ConEd system level, cogeneration-related changes may be negligible and
can be ignored, but they're large enough to distort results at the network
level. It's important to remove these outliers for network-level analyses. For
the most accurate network-level analysis, it would be ideal to have a dataset
where the cogeneration maintenance is clearly flagged or where
cogeneration-related energy use can be separated from other energy use.

## TV/load regression model

To model the TV/load relationship, we use a cubic polynomial regression.
@nyiso_load_2021 provides background on the cubic polynomial models used in New
York load modeling.

Two issues arose when applying this regression. The first is identifying
outliers, notably the cogeneration outliers. Our current solution combines
robust regression, Tukey's fences[^tukey], and a voting system. We implemented
this before we understood the cogeneration issue, so it's an ad hoc approach
rather than a fully-planned solution.

[^tukey]: Many people will know Tukey's fences from its use for boxplots. It
creates thresholds for outliers based on the interquartile range.

1) First we fit the TV/load polynomial regression using an alternative method
   based on robust statistics.
1) We then apply Tukey's fences to the regression residuals. In this step we
   apply it with a relatively low threshold to identify sequences of outliers
   with length $\geq$ 5. This is meant to identify the cogeneration maintenance.
1) For the remaining observations, we apply Tukey's fences again with a higher
   threshold, to identify isolated outliers.
1) We repeat steps 1-3 using TV from different weather stations, and only mark
   observations as outliers when the results from the stations are unanimous. We
   use a subset of stations spread across NYC for this.
1) After the outliers have been identified, we then fit the polynomial
   regression on the remaining data using the normal method.

There's no guarantee that this method will identify every case of cogeneration
maintenance, so we'd also like to apply a weight of 0.5 to days in the first
half of May and the last half of September (but this weighting hasn't been
implemented yet).

We've carefully checked to confirm this outlier detection system works well,
though we'd still like to simplify the process and adopt methods that are more
narrowly tailored to this problem.

The second issue is that the TV/load relationship changes from year to year,
raising the question of how to account for this change within the cubic
polynomial model. Some options are

1) allow a different constant term for each year
1) multiply the values of each year by a scaling factor, and
1) allow all polynomial coefficients to change each year

The multiplication option can't be implemented in a standard linear regression,
so we focus on options 1) and 3) here. The equations for these two options are
shown below:

\begin{align*}
Y &= \beta_0 year2021 + \beta_1 year2022 + \beta_2 year2023 + \beta_3 \mathrm{TV} + \beta_4 \mathrm{TV}^2 + \beta_5 \mathrm{TV}^3 + \varepsilon \tag{1} \\
Y &= year2021 \times (\beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathrm{TV} + \beta_2 \mathrm{TV}^2 + \beta_3 \mathrm{TV}^3)\\
&\quad + year2022 \times (\beta_4 + \beta_5 \mathrm{TV} + \beta_6 \mathrm{TV}^2 + \beta_7 \mathrm{TV}^3) \\
&\quad + year2023 \times (\beta_8 + \beta_9 \mathrm{TV} + \beta_{10} \mathrm{TV}^2 + \beta_{11} \mathrm{TV}^3) + \varepsilon \tag{3}
\end{align*}

where the year terms are dummy variables.

```{r pooled-pval}
pooled_pval = readRDS('results/load_vs_weather/pooled_pval.rds')
pooled_pval_exp = as.character(ceiling(log10(pooled_pval)))
```

For each network, we used ANOVA to compare regressions 1) and 3). Each
comparison provides a p-value for the null hypothesis that equation 3) provides
no benefit over equation 1). We then pool the p-values from all networks using
Fisher's method [@fisher_statistical_1925]. The resulting overall p-value is
less than 10^`r#pooled_pval_exp`^. This result demonstrates that at least some
networks are changing in ways that aren't captured by regression 1), and these
changes can't be explained as random noise. Therefore we use regression 3).


# Sea breeze

## Summary statistics and spatial patterns

@gedzelman_mesoscale_2003 provides background information about the NYC sea
breeze. We apply their definition to identify sea breeze events:

> The criterion used to define a day with a strong sea breeze is that at 1600
> local time, temperature at NYC must be at least 2.2Â°C warmer than at JFK, and
> the southerly component of the wind at JFK must exceed that at NYC by 5 kt.

Using this definitions, sea breeze events occur on about `r#sea_breeze_pct`% of
days from May through September. Most sea breeze temperature gradients are less
than 5Â°F, though a couple have been greater than 10Â°F.

```{r sea-breeze-gradients, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
sea_breeze_gradients = readRDS('results/weather/sea_breeze_gradients.rds')
hist(sea_breeze_gradients, main = 'NYC - JFK temperatures\n4pm sea breeze days',
     freq = F, xlab = 'Â°F', ylab = 'Proportion')
```

@gedzelman_mesoscale_2003 also includes a helpful map of temperatures during a
sea breeze event (reproduced below). During this event, steep temperature
gradients run through Staten Island and Manhattan.

```{r sea-breeze-gedzelman}
include_graphics('papers/gedzelman_sea_breeze.png', dpi = 140)
```

## Identifying sea breeze impacts using multidimensional scaling and PCA

Because the boundary of the sea breeze varies from day to day, analyzing sea
breeze patterns at the level of individual temperature observations is
difficult. To simplify the analysis, we instead examine temperature
*correlations* between weather stations.

These correlations can be used as a measure of similarity between stations.
Similarity measures can be used by methods such as multidimensional scaling
(MDS) or principal components analysis (PCA) to reveal underlying patterns.

MDS takes a matrix of distances or similarities as input, and produces a
two-dimensional set of coordinates consistent with the distances. For example,
if the distances are flight times between US cities, MDS will produce city
coordinates that closely match the layout of US cities.

In this case, we use the R package smacof [@mair_more_2022] to perform MDS on
4pm temperature correlations. We chose 4pm to match the timing of daily peak
temperatures and loads. We use the following equation to create the distance
matrix:

$$
\mathrm{distance}_{ij} = a + b \sqrt{1 - \mathrm{corr}(\mathrm{TMP}_i, \mathrm{TMP}_j)}
$$

where $i$ and $j$ are weather stations. The square root transformation is
recommended by the smacof package to transform correlations into distances, and
the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are estimated as part of the MDS procedure. The
offset $a$ accounts for the possibility that correlations may be less than 1
even at zero distance due to measurement error.

MDS produces the coordinates below (stations are colored by borough and state).
The coordinates have no physical units, and only reflect relative similarity,
with closer stations being more similar.

```{r tmp-coordinates}
tv_coords = readRDS('results/weather/temperature_mds.rds')
site_boroughs = as.data.frame(stations)[row.names(tv_coords$conf), 'borough']
site_boroughs[is.na(site_boroughs)] = 'NA'
plot(tv_coords, col = factor(site_boroughs), cex = 2,
     label.conf = list(cex = 0.6))
sb1 = prcomp(tv_coords$conf)
abline(0, with(sb1, rotation[2, 1] / rotation[1, 1]), lty = 'dashed')
```

The dashed line shows the direction of the first principle component of the
coordinates, which is the direction that contains most of the variation in the
coordinates. When plotted on a map (below), the coordinates along this direction
resemble the gradient shown in the sea breeze figure from
@gedzelman_mesoscale_2003. Our conclusion is that this dimension represents sea
breeze impacts. We don't know of any other process that would create this
pattern in afternoon temperature correlations.

```{r sea-breeze-mds, fig.height=4, message=FALSE}
stations %>%
  transform(`Sea breeze` = sb1$x[stations$stid, 1]) %>%
  plot_station_data(aes(color = `Sea breeze`, shape = network), size = 3.5) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(size = 7))
```

The second dimension in these coordinates, at a right angle to the sea breeze
dimension, seems to be an east-west dimension, which probably reflects weather
fronts moving across NYC in that direction.

To check that this result is applicable to TV, we ran the same analysis on TV
values. The results show the same broad pattern, though a bit noisier.

To run a similar analysis that includes ConEd networks, we created a second
distance matrix, this time based on R^2^ values. In this matrix, the entries are
defined as

$$
\mathrm{distance}_{ij} = \sqrt{1 - \mathrm{R}^2_{ij}}
$$

where $i$ is a ConEd network and $j$ is a weather station. The $\mathrm{R}^2$ is
taken from the regression of the corresponding network loads and station TV
values, using the polynomial regression discussed under [TV/load regression
model](#tvload-regression-model).

These distances are more complicated due to the inclusion of ConEd networks.
They're affected not just by weather patterns, but also by network properties.
This causes problems for methods like MDS that attempt to represent the data in
just a few dimensions.

In this case we get clearer results from PCA. PCA extracts underlying components
from the data by finding the directions in the data (principal components) that
have the most variation. The components are ordered by the amount of variance
they explain, so that the first component explains the most variance.

In our results, the first component represents the overall weather
predictability (of networks) and predictiveness (of weather stations). Network
predictability is closely related to network loads, with higher load networks
being more predictable, and thus having higher R^2^ values. Weather station
variation is much smaller in this dimension, and we haven't found a physical
explanation of the values. For example, they have no clear relationship to site
characteristics.

```{r mds-pca-corr}
pc_dist = readRDS('results/load_vs_weather/tv_load_pca.rds')
# make sure to get the stations in the same order for each!
mds_pca_corr = cor(sb1$x[, 1], pc_dist$rotation[row.names(sb1$x), 2]) %>%
  abs %>%
  round(2) %>%
  as.character
```

The second component appears to capture the same sea breeze pattern from before,
and the coordinates are plotted below. The station coordinates from PCA have a
`r#mds_pca_corr` correlation with the coordinates from MDS, so we're confident
that both methods have identified the same process. Note that the station and
network coordinates have different meanings in PCA, so they can't be directly
compared:

```{r tv-load-coordinates-stations, fig.height=8}
p1 = stations %>%
  transform(`Sea breeze` = -pc_dist$rotation[stid, 2]) %>%
  plot_station_data(aes(color = `Sea breeze`, shape = network), size = 3.5) +
  theme(legend.justification = c(0, .5), plot.caption = element_text(size = 7))
p2 = networks %>%
  transform(`Sea breeze` = pc_dist$x[id, 2]) %>%
  plot_network_data(aes(fill = `Sea breeze`)) +
  theme(legend.justification = c(0, .5), plot.caption = element_text(size = 7))
grid::grid.draw(rbind(ggplotGrob(p1), ggplotGrob(p2), size = 'last'))
```

Based on these results, we can conclude that:

- the sea breeze is the most important determinant of station-to-station
  correlations in afternoon temperatures and ConEd's TV
- at the network level, for regression models that predict peak load using TV,
  the sea breeze is the most important determinant of prediction accuracy after
  accounting for network size

These results give us reason to believe that ConEd's TV can be improved by
including stations from multiple locations along this sea breeze dimension, to
better reflect weather variation within NYC.


# TV station selection

TV's relation to load depends on the weather stations used to calculate it.
ConEd currently uses NYC and LGA to create TV, while NYISO uses NYC, LGA, and
JFK to create their CTHI [@nyiso_load_2021, p. 20]. Our goal in this section is
to estimate how much TV's load prediction accuracy can be improved by including
additional stations in the TV calculation.

To choose station combinations, we use stepwise forward selection. For each
combination of stations being considered, we calculate TV[^tv], then we fit the
cubic polynomial regression discussed under [TV/load regression
model](#tvload-regression-model). We choose the station combination that
minimizes the mean squared error. We excluded station JRB due to a large amount
of missing data.

[^tv]: Our TV calculation does not necessarily follow every detail of the
    official Con Edison methodology. We don't expect the differences to have any
    practical impact on the results of this section.

Stepwise forward selection was chosen for its simplicity.
@moreno-carbonell_rethinking_2020 is an example of a more sophisticated method
that could be applied. We don't know how much the results would change if we
used a different method.

We validate this procedure using 10-fold cross validation. For each of 10
iterations, we run the stepwise forward selection procedure on 9/10ths of the
data, and the accuracy is measured on the remaining 1/10th. This gives us a
reliable estimate of the accuracy resulting from this procedure.

For comparison purposes, we also run 10-fold cross validation on the cubic
polynomial using NYC and LGA stations for TV. The results for both methods are
shown below. Aside from root mean squared error (RMSE), we also report mean
absolute error (MAE) because it has a more intuitive explanation. Units are MW.

```{r system-results, results='asis'}
sys_tv_tab = system_results$errors
# change to RMSE
sys_tv_tab[, 1] = sqrt(sys_tv_tab[, 1])
colnames(sys_tv_tab)[1] = 'rmse'
# add percent improvement
sys_tv_tab = addmargins(sys_tv_tab, 1, function(x) {
  round(100 * (1 - (x[2] / x[1])), 1)
})
# clean it up a bit
sys_tv_tab[1:2, ] = round(sys_tv_tab[1:2, ])
colnames(sys_tv_tab) = toupper(colnames(sys_tv_tab))
row.names(sys_tv_tab)[3] = '% improvement'
# make sure the rounding is displayed how I want it
sys_tv_tab[1:2, ] = as.character(sys_tv_tab[1:2, ])
sys_tv_tab[3, ] = format(sys_tv_tab[3, ], nsmall = 1)
# get station list as text
sys_stations = paste0(paste(head(system_results$stids, -1), collapse = ', '),
                      ', and ', tail(system_results$stids, 1))
kable(sys_tv_tab)
```

The stepwise forward selection chose stations `r#sys_stations`.

```{r network-improvement-max}
mae_comparison = readRDS('results/select_stations/mae_comparison.rds')
network_mae_pdiff = with(mae_comparison, 100 * (1 - (stfor / orig)))
network_max_red = max(network_mae_pdiff) %>%
  round %>%
  as.character
```

We run the same comparisons for peak loads at the network level. Results are
shown in the plot below. Stepwise forward site selection provides little to no
improvement for networks in Manhattan and the Bronx, but networks in other
boroughs see prediction errors reduced by up to `r#network_max_red`%.

```{r network-improvements, message=FALSE}
networks %>%
  transform(mae_pdiff = with(mae_comparison, 100 * (1 - (stfor / orig)))) %>%
  plot_network_data(aes(fill = mae_pdiff)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c('MAE % reduction')
```

```{r network-station-count}
stforw_sites_list = readRDS('results/select_stations/selected_sites.rds')
network_stations_med = median(lengths(stforw_sites_list)) %>%
  as.character
```

We also plot the network-level selected stations below, where each colored grid
cell is a selected station. The axes are ordered by the sea breeze dimension to
show sea breeze-related patterns. The relationship is noisy, but stations that
are more affected by the sea breeze are more likely to be selected by networks
affected by the sea breeze, and vice versa. The median number of selected
stations is `r#network_stations_med`.

```{r selected-stations, fig.height=9}
# need to unlist this somehow
stforw_sites = unlist(stforw_sites_list) %>%
  { data.frame(network = names(.), stid = .) } %>%
  transform(network = sub('[0-9]*$', '', network))
network_sb_order = with(pc_dist, row.names(x)[order(x[, 2])])
station_sb_order = with(sb1, row.names(x)[order(x[, 1])])
# JRB shouldn't be in here
station_sb_order = station_sb_order[station_sb_order != 'JRB']
stforw_sites %>%
  transform(network = factor(network, network_sb_order),
            station = factor(stid, station_sb_order),
            # This is an odd way to select a column. But it's required due to sf
            weather_network = stations[stid, ]$network) %>%
  ggplot(aes(station, network, fill = weather_network)) +

# TV and load forecasts

Physical weather models have biases that can be corrected with statistical and
machine learning methods [@rasp_neural_2018]. This approach is called model
output statistics (MOS). MOS is often applied for uses that require accurate
forecasts.

In contrast, short-term load forecasting (STLF) methods typically use weather
observations instead of forecasts, so they don't account for weather forecast
biases [@yang_historical_2022; @ludwig_probabilistic_2023]. This may be because
historical forecast data has been difficult to obtain until recently, and
because the data is stored in obscure formats that are difficult to work with.

To forecast TV, we can apply MOS methods that have been shown to work well. This
is a straightforward application of existing methods.

To forecast load, we can combine elements of MOS and STLF methods. This is a
more open-ended and exploratory project. We're hoping this will lead to
improvements over STLF without MOS.
